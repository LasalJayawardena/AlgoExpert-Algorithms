# Problem 5 - Non Constructible Change
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given an array/list of integers which represent the coins we have in our possession, return the minimum amount of change that cannot be created.</p>
<b>Aim: Solve with Minimum Time Complexity and Space Complexity.</b>

## Important Considerations

- There can be coins of the same value(Duplicates).
- Coins are in cents ₵.
- There are no negative integers.


## Example
```python
# list of integers

coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]

# Function must return 20 (which represents 20₵)
```
