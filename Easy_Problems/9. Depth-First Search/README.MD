# Problem 9 - Depth-First Search
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given an acyclic tree-like graph. Each node in this graph is going to be an instance of a <code>Node</code> class</p>
<p>Write a <code>depthFirstSearch</code> method on the <code>Node</code> class, which is going to accept an empty array as argument and perform a depth-first search on the graph.</p>
<b>Aim: Implement the DFS algorithm.</b>

## Important Considerations

- The graph is acyclic and tree-like, it means the graph is directed and all the nodes except the root node has only one parent.
- No need to use a data structure to keep track of the nodes that have been visited
- Store the names of all the nodes in the input array and return that array.
- The nodes should be visited from left to right.
