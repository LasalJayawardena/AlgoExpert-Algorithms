# Problem 10 - Minimum Waiting Time
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given an array of positive integers. Each integer in the input array represents the duration of a query that needs to be executed.</p>
<p>Write a function that is going to return the minimum amount of <b>total waiting time</b> for all the queries.</p>
<p>Waiting time - Amount of time a query waites till it starts executing.</p>
<b>Aim: Solve with Minimum Time Complexity and Space Complexity.</b>

## Important Considerations

- Only one query can be executed at a time. 
- Queries can be executed in any order.
- Mutatation of the input array is allowed.
- Atleast one query is given.


## Example
```python
# list of integers (waiting times)

coins = [3, 2, 1, 2, 6]

# Function must return 17 which is the total minimum waiting time
```
