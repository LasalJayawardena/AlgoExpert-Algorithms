# Problem 2 - Validate Subsequence
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given two arrays/lists of integers , find whether the second array is a subsequence of the first array.</p>
<p>Subsequence Definition: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">Check Definition</a></p>
<b>Aim: Solve with Minimum Time Complexity and Space Complexity.</b>

## Important Considerations

- The Two arrays/lists are not Empty. 
- Order of integers in the array/list is important
- The two arrays/lists can be of same size.

## Example
```python
# Two lists of integers

first_list = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
second_list = [1, 6, -1, 10]

# Function must return "True"
```
