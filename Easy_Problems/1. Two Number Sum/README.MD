# Problem 1 - Two Number Sum
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given an array/list of integers and a target(integer), return whether or not there is a pair of numbers such that they add up to the target.</p>
<b>Aim: Solve with Minimum Time Complexity and Space Complexity.</b>

## Important Considerations

- Return the pair of numbers from the function. 
- Return empty list if numbers are not fond.
- The integer list is not sorted.
- There can be positive and negative integers.


## Example
```python
# list of integers

main_list = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
target = 10

# Function must return the indices of 11 and -1
```
