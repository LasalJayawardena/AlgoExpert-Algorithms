# Problem 7 - Branch Sums
--------------------

## Problem Definition

<p>Given a Binary Search Tree(BST), calculate the Branch sums and return it as a list of integers.</p>
<p>Branch - A path that starts at the root node and ends at one of the leaf nodes.</p>
<p>Branch Sum - Sum of all values in a branch.</p>
<b>Aim: Solve with Minimum Time Complexity and Space Complexity.</b>

## Important Considerations

- The BST passed is valid.
- Calculate sum of all branches.
- There can be negative integers.


## Example
```python
# BST

bst = BST([....])
# Visulization of the BST
-------------------------
          1
#       /    \
#      2       3
#    /   \   /   \
#   4     5 6     7
#  / \
# 8   9

target = 5

# Function must return [15, 16, 8, 10, 11]
```
